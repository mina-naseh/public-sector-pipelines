# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA
The 2nd project focused on analyzing a time series of crude oil prices through data cleaning, stationarity checks, transformation, and forecasting using an ARIMA model. We began by addressing missing values with a rolling average and detecting outliers using methods like Isolation Forest. Stationarity was tested using ADF and KPSS tests, supported by ACF and PACF plots, which revealed non-stationarity. To address this, first-order differencing was applied, transforming the series into a stationary form suitable for modeling.

An ARIMA(1,0,1) model was selected based on information criteria and residual diagnostics. One-step-ahead forecasts were performed with an expanding window approach, achieving an RMSE of 0.0459. While the forecasts captured general trends, they were less responsive to spikes, suggesting room for improvement with non-linear models. This analysis highlights the importance of stationarity and careful model selection for accurate time series forecasting.

# Time Series Forecasting with VAR
In 3rd project, we examined the relationship between Brent and WTI crude oil prices, focusing on their percentage changes to ensure stationarity. After preprocessing the data by handling missing values and outliers, we confirmed stationarity through statistical tests. Exploratory analysis revealed a moderate to strong correlation between the two variables, suggesting a significant relationship. Granger causality tests further showed that WTI strongly influences Brent, making it a key driver in this relationship.

Using a VAR model with an optimal lag of 7 (based on AIC), we performed one-step-ahead forecasts for the test set. Evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, RMSPE) highlighted moderate accuracy, with errors reflecting the inherent volatility of oil prices. Impulse response analysis showed that Brent exhibits an immediate and significant response to shocks in WTI, with the impact decaying quickly and stabilizing over time. Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD) confirmed that WTI is largely self-determined (~97%), while Brent's variance is significantly influenced by WTI (~50%). Overall, the results underscore WTI's role as a driving force in global oil markets and the interconnectedness of these two major benchmarks.
